# PAPER DRAGON
A qualitative decision-intelligence case study on national deterrence and why a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is structurally infeasible.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Escalation of world tension and recent deterioration in geopolitics have prompted a revival of Taiwan invasion narratives. Paper Dragon argues that Taiwan's strategic value — specifically TSMC — creates a self-reinforcing deterrence mechanism that structurally contains Beijing's reunification ambitions.

The "Silicon Shield" transforms Taiwan from a territorial, regional objective into a global, systematic chokepoint. Any possible seizure of the island state triggers cascading consequences that directly threaten China's domestic stability, interests, and long-term growth trajectory.

The Paper Dragon repository aims to document Beijing's decision logic tree, core regime mandates, and possible courses of actions tying back to the reunification of "One China." 

## CORE THESIS
Paper Dragon asserts that Beijing is a rational actor, and ultimately acts with the intent to preserve regime continuity. Therefore, a conventional invasion of Taiwan would trigger:
- Near-universal geopolitical backlash.
- Near-universal sanctions / economic punishment.
- Rapid formation of an international coalition aligned against China.
- A U.S. military response.
- A collapse of the global semiconductor supply chain via TSMC denial tactics.
- A global recession with disproportionate harm towards China.

All of which not only threatens CCP legitimacy, but also regime continuity.

Taiwan's "Silicon Shield" deterrence persists not because China lacks the required military capability, but because the payoff matrix poses no paths that end in the survival of the CCP.

## THESIS DEPENDENCIES
Taiwan's "Silicon Shield" deterrence functions as a result of:
- The entire global AI economy effectively relying on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and its continued operational capability.

Heavy reliance on TSMC is precisely why the U.S. has a vested interest in the preservation of Taiwan and its autonomy / independence.

Paper Dragon's core thesis argues that unless TSMC-level fabrication is replicated elsewhere and global AI economies decouple from Taiwan reliance, a conventional invasion remains structurally infeasible.

## DECISION FRAMEWORK (SUMMARY)
Observers misread Beijing's actions or rhetoric as ideological or emotional. Paper Dragon rejects this framing.

The CCP operates under a single, primary constraint: maintain internal stability and regime control at all costs. A conventional invasion of Taiwan violates this mandate:
- Economic sanctions / pressure / contraction risks unemployment and unrest. Wealth destruction undermines the CCP's social legitimacy.
- U.S. / international coalition response places China's military against overwhelming odds. Protracted conflict feeds populace dissatisfaction, erodes party credibility, and greatly weakens Beijing's capacity to project power regionally.
- Global recession — as a result of TSMC ruin and chip supply chain destruction — affects China disproportionately due to their economic reliance on exports.

## SCOPE LIMITATION
This case study focuses primarily on:
- Qualitative decision constraints.
- Avoids ideological or moral aspects.
- Separates what is "theoretically possible" and what is "realistically possible."

Paper Dragon acknowledges that geopolitics and global dynamics is an ever-changing subject. Future developments may render the thesis partially or completely invalid. It is the objective of this analysis to assess why a conventional invasion of Taiwan by China, under current circumstances, is structurally infeasible.

This analysis assumes rational, continuity-oriented behavior by the CCP leadership and excludes scenarios driven by internal collapse, miscalculations, or uncontrolled escalations. This analysis also assumes Taiwan not as a territorial dispute, but as a systematic constraint on global conflict.
